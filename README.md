# Meeting Cost Calculator (Kotlin)
A Kotlin JVM version of the meeting cost calculator!

## What does it do?
This app will estimate how much money you lost on that last meeting you just had!

## How?
Using user input on the number of people in the meeting, the average (estimated) salary of the people in the call, and the time the meeting went on for.

You can also run it in realtime mode to see how much money you are burning in the meeting you are currently in!
